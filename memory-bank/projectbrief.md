# Project Brief

## Project Name
CrapsSim

## Overview
CrapsSim is a Python-based simulation tool designed to model and analyze various strategies for the game of craps. It provides a structured environment to execute craps strategies just like playing at a real casino. CrapsSim provides a framework for defining bets, dice rolls, and table states, allowing users to simulate game outcomes and evaluate the performance of different betting strategies. We use this simulation environment to design, test, and evaluate strategies of game play (what bets to make when). 

## Core Requirements
- Provide a simulation environment that is true to real casino Craps with accurate bet options, odds, and payouts. 
- Provide a facility to describe betting systems (aka strategies) 
- Provide an environment to run one or more strategies during simulated game play (aka simulations) 
- Comprehensive data logging and analysis capabilities to evaluate strategy performance, risk, and profitability. (See [`memory-bank/analyticsRequirements.md`](memory-bank/analyticsRequirements.md) for detailed requirements.)

## Goals
- Provide a reliable and accurate craps simulation.
- Enable users to test and optimize their betting strategies.
- Offer insights into the probabilities and outcomes of craps.
- Serve as a learning tool for understanding craps mechanics, craps strategy, and statistical analysis.

## Initial Scope
- Basic craps game flow (come-out roll, point phase).
- Core bet types (Pass Line, Don't Pass, Odds, Come, Don't Come, Field, Hopper, etc.).
- Common / popular strategy implementation examples.
- Collection and Storage of simulations, results, and analysis

## Future Considerations
- Additional bet types (Lay, other missing bets)
- Custom strategies.
- Graphical user interface (GUI) for visualization.
