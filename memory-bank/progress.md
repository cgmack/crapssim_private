# Progress

## What Works
- We have cloned the upstream crampsim repo and run the existing tests to validate Table, Player, and Bet functionality. 
- The Memory Bank files have been created and populated with initial content along with a development plan to extent crampsim for strategy analysis. 
- The new simulation module has been implemented
- Raw data logging and saving the the database has been implemented

## What's Left to Build
- Implementation of the analytics data logging system as outlined in [`memory-bank/activeContext.md`](memory-bank/activeContext.md). This includes:
    - **Database schema definition and updates for PostgreSQL, specifically adding the `strategy_configurations` table and linking it to `simulations`.** (Next Step)
    - **Update `crapssim/db_utils.py`**: Define the new `strategy_configurations` table and modify the `simulations` table.
    - **Update `crapssim/logger.py`**: Adjust `SimulationLogger` to handle `Strategy_Config_ID`.
    - **Update `crapssim/simulation.py`**: Implement logic to manage `Strategy_Config_ID` creation/retrieval.
    - **Update `crapssim/analytics.py`**: Adapt data retrieval and processing to use `strategy_configurations`.
    - **Update GUI Backend (`gui/backend/app.py`)**: Modify API endpoints to fetch and serve strategy configuration data.
    - **Update GUI Frontend (`gui/frontend/src/App.js` and other React components)**: Adapt UI to display strategy configuration details.
    - Creation and integration of the `SimulationLogger` class. (Completed)
    - Modifications to `crapssim/table.py` and `crapssim/player.py` for data capture. (Completed)
    - Development of `crapssim/simulation.py` for full simulation orchestration. (Completed)
    - Implementation of data analysis and metrics calculation. (Completed)
    - Saving completed analysis to the database. (Completed)
    - Create Basic GUI framework and navigation
    - Create standardized “report card” for each strategy.
    - Create a central dashboard compares simulations.
    - Create Side by side deep dive comparisons report.
    - Create Dice roll analysis report.

## Current Status
Phase 1 (Database Setup and Logger Foundation), Phase 2 (Integration into Simulation Flow), and Phase 3.2 (Data Analysis and Metrics Calculation) of the analytics data logging system have been successfully implemented and tested. This includes:
- Defining the PostgreSQL database schema and creating `crapssim/db_utils.py` for connection and table management.
- Implementing the `SimulationLogger` class in `crapssim/logger.py` for in-memory data buffering and flushing to the database.
- Integrating the logger into `crapssim/table.py` and `crapssim/player.py` for data capture.
- Creating `crapssim/simulation.py` to orchestrate full simulation runs and manage the logging process.
- Developing `crapssim/analytics.py` with functions to fetch data and calculate various analytical metrics.
- Unit tests for `db_utils.py`, `logger.py`, and `analytics.py` have passed.
- An integration test for `simulation.py` has passed, verifying data integrity across all tables in the PostgreSQL database.
All phases of the analytics data logging system, including saving the completed analysis to the database (Phase 3.3), have been successfully implemented and tested.

## Known Issues
- None at this time.

## Resolved Issues
- All failing tests have been resolved, including the `NameError` in `crapssim/analytics.py`.
