# Progress

## What Works
- We have cloned the upstream crampsim repo and run the existing tests to validate Table, Player, and Bet functionality. 
- The Memory Bank files have been created and populated with initial content along with a development plan to extent crampsim for strategy analysis. 

## What's Left to Build
- Implementation of the analytics data logging system as outlined in [`memory-bank/activeContext.md`](memory-bank/activeContext.md). This includes:
    - Database schema definition and connection utilities for PostgreSQL.
    - Creation and integration of the `SimulationLogger` class.
    - Modifications to `crapssim/table.py` and `crapssim/player.py` for data capture.
    - Development of `crapssim/simulation.py` for full simulation orchestration.
    - Implementation of data analysis and metrics calculation.
    - Saving completed analysis to the database.

## Current Status
The Memory Bank initialization is complete. All required foundational documents are present and contain initial context for the CrapsSim project. It is time to start work. See activeContext.md.

## Known Issues
- None at this time.
